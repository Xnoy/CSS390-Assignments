Things to Note:
Many of the scripts have default values that will allow to run the scripts
to run in most cases. It should be noted that all of those values can be 
changed by using the optional command line arguement options.

Plot.py is dependant on Plot.plt. It also needs GNUplot to be installed 
on the computer running it to work properly.

Trafficgen.py will run forever, there are no options to make it run more 
a timed span.

Program was tested on Python 2.7


Traffic Generator. This script is meant to generate traffic to
a server at a port of the users choosing. It is mean to simulate traffic to
a website. In this simulation, it can generate 200s, 500s, and 404 errors.
At the very least, this program can generate 500 requests per second.

usage: trafficgen.py [-h] [--url URL] [--rps RPS] [--jitter JITTER]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --url URL, -u URL     The URL that you want to hit. Default =
                        http://localhost:8080
  --rps RPS, -r RPS     The rate you want to hit the URL. Default = 500
  --jitter JITTER, -j JITTER
                        Floating-point number in the range of [0..1]
                        representing the shakiness of the rate. Default = .02



Collector. This script to used to scrape the server for the
current count of 200s, 500s, and 404 errors. After pulling this data it will
store these values in a TSV file call collected. The user has the option to
change the interval at which data is collected, the URL to collect from,
and the number of times to repeat the interval.

usage: collector.py [-h] [--url URL] [--interval INTERVAL] [--repeat REPEAT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --url URL, -u URL     The URL that you want to collect from. Default =
                        http://localhost:8080
  --interval INTERVAL, -i INTERVAL
                        The interval you want to collect data at in seconds.
                        Default = 10 seconds
  --repeat REPEAT, -r REPEAT
                        The number of times you want to repeat the interval.
                        Default = -1 (forever)




Plot. This script is used to create a graph of the collected
data. This program will only create a graph for 1 minute intervals

usage: plot.py [-h] [--file FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --file FILE, -f FILE  The file to read the data from. Default =
                        collected.tsv
