This assignment is meant to show the power of the unix commands. While by themselves, they can accomplish basic task, together they can form a very fast and effective
tool for getting a job done quickly. By using pipes information between these commands can be shared allowing for a 100 line C++ program to become less than 10. 

If you plan to view the shell code, I would recommend open it on a Linux enviroment as it will not format properly on Windows.

To run this shell script, you will need to provide the path to the Music folder

For example, if the Music folder is in the same folder as the shell script then use the following command: ./assignment1 ./Music

This however does not mean that the script needs to be in the same folder as the Music folder. 
You could have the Music folder in the parent 
of the current directory and access that file by using the following command ./assignment1.sh ../Music 


It should also be noted that standard output can be redirected to a file if the user wishes to. This can be done by using the command ./assignment1.sh ../Music 
> foo.txt
